<h1><strong>What to Expect:</strong></h1>
<h3>The SAT has two major sections: the evidence-based reading and writing section and the math section. The reading and
    writing portion of the test contains a 65-minute reading section that tests evidence-based logic and a 35-minute
    writing and language section that covers contextual word knowledge. The math section includes a 25-minute
    no-calculator section focusing on problem solving and data analysis and a 55-minute section where you will need a
    calculator for the problems. </h3>
<h3>With this general test structure in mind, students should note the specific changes in each section. </h3>
    <h1><strong>Reading</strong></h1>
<h3>The reading section requires students to complete 52 passage-based questions in 65 minutes. The section may ask
    test-takers to determine the meaning of words in context, to identify the main idea of a passage, or to compare two
    passages. Reading questions include evidence support questions, which ask student to cite evidence from a passage,
    and data reasoning questions, where students analyze a reading passage. </h3>
<h3>It is important for students to learn how to analyze arguments. Read plenty of traditional publications, such as a
    newspaper, to identify the structure behind arguments. Understanding how to read graphs will also be important in
    this section. </h3>
<h3>
    <ul>&#9679 Read carefully and use the process of elimination to increase your chances of choosing the correct multiple
    choice answer.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Be careful with multiple-part questions, as a wrong answer to one question might lead you astray on subsequent
        parts. Be sure there actually is evidence for your conclusion, and not just an "easy" or obvious answer. This
        may sometimes manifest itself as a personal bias.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Do not let personal bias cloud your judgment. Answers do not take extreme stances on topics. If an answer seems
        too extreme, or seems to support a stance that the College Board would not approve, chances are it is not the
        correct answer.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Beware of extremes and controversial statements. These are usually tricks to prey on personal biases.</ul>
</h3>
<br>
<h1><strong>Writing and Language</strong></h1>
<h3>The writing section is comprised of 44 multiple choice questions that should be completed in 35 minutes. The writing
    section tests grammatical knowledge and allows students to think like editors by fixing mistakes in sentences and
    identifying grammatical errors. </h3>
<h3>Eliminating obviously incorrect answers should be your first step; if you can identify a definite wrong answer, your
    chance of picking the correct one increases. </h3>
<h3>
    <ul>&#9679 Read carefully and identify easily eliminable answers.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Remember that colloquial language and written language are often dissimilar. They way people speak is not
        necessarily grammatically correct. The test sometimes takes advantage of this and tries to trick you.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Don't blindly guess. Try to eliminate at least one answer.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Don't spend too much time on one question. Read it and move on. Return later if you can't answer quickly.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Don't go for the obvious answer, especially later in the section, where questions are designed to trip students
        in a rush.</ul>
</h3>
<br>

<br>
<h1><strong>Essay</strong></h1>
<h3>The SAT essay section is optional and students should check with their target schools to determine if it is required
    for admission. The essay section is 50 minutes long and presents a passage in which the author takes a stance on a
    certain topic. The student must analyze and explain how the author builds their argument. There will no longer be a
    theoretical prompt as on the old SAT. You must keep your personal opinions out of the answer. Instead, focus on the
    analysis. </h3>
<h3>Cite evidence. This essay prompt asks the student to identify textual evidence in support of their analysis of the
    author's argument. Building an argument requires higher-level reasoning. The student must identify how the author
    uses data to build a larger argument. Students must be aware of the stylistic devices the author uses to persuade
    the reader. </h3>
<h3>
    <ul>&#9679 Focus only on textual evidence.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Be aware of personal bias and avoid building arguments from a personal point of view that is not related to
        evidence in the passage.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Write as neatly as possible; legibility can impact your score.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Structure the essay in a five paragraph format (including an intro, evidence, and a conclusion).</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Create or fabricate examples.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Let personal bias impinge on your analysis of the argument.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Get off-topic.</ul>
</h3>
<br>
<h1><strong>No-Calculator Math Section</strong></h1>
<h3>The no-calculator math section is comprised of 20 questions (15 multiple choice and five grid-in) to be completed in
    25 minutes. Math topics on this section include algebra, arithmetic, probability, and data analysis, along with some
    geometry and trigonometry. </h3>
<h3>Students will be provided with some basic formulas at the start of the section. It is worth memorizing these so that
    you don't waste time flipping back and forth to reference them. </h3>
<h3>
    <ul>&#9679 Identify your strengths and weaknesses and focus on building a strong overall skill set. Focus on weak points.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Read these questions carefully. The math format emphasizes long-format questions that require careful scrutiny,
        especially for multi-part questions.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 On equation-based questions, plug in answers to the formula, and test them. This can help you save precious time.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Don't rely on your calculator excessively; sometimes the calculator can actually slow you down.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Don't spend too much time on any one question. If you don't get it initially, return to it later.</ul>
</h3>
<br>
<h1><strong>Calculator Permitted Math Section</strong></h1>
<h3>Many of the calculator permitted math questions are real-world style examples that use graphs and word problem
    formats. Calculators may or may not be required to complete these questions. </h3>
<h3>As always, read carefully. These questions are often asked in a complex word-problem format. Eliminate obviously
    wrong answer choices.</h3>
<h3>
    <ul>&#9679 Learn common formulas ahead of time.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Plug in answers on equation-based questions.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Re-check answers if time allows.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679 Don't rely too heavily on the calculator.</ul>
    <ul>&#9679Don't bring a non-approved calculator to the test site!</ul>
</h3>
