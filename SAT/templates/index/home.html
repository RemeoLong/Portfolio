<h1><strong>What is the SAT?</strong></h1>
<h3>The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is a standardized test created by the College Board that most colleges and
   universities use to evaluate incoming students. Schools use the test to evaluate college readiness in applicants,
   alongside their high school GPA, transcripts, letters of recommendation, and extracurricular activities.</h3>

<h3>The test is typically offered October through January, and in March, May, June, and August each year. It is comprised
    of a combined reading/writing section and a math section, each scored out of 800 points. The revised essay section
    is graded separately. The test format emphasizes context of vocabulary, scientific reasoning, and your ability to
    form logical arguments in the reading section. The test evaluates the logic of your ideas and punctuation skills on
    the writing section, while data analysis and real world problem solving are crucial in the math section.</h3>

<h1><strong>Preparing for the SAT</strong></h1>
<h3>It's useful to know as much about the test format as possible. The reading section contains set topic sections
    including one US/world literature passage, two history/social science passages, and two science passages. All
    vocabulary will be tested in context. Because of this, studying just vocabulary is less important than doing
    advanced reading. Familiarizing yourself with diverse real world publications is a great starting place to start
    studying.</h3>

<h3>Old SAT test prep books can still be useful too. Just be sure to skip over problems that are no longer included,
    like sentence completion problems and isolated vocabulary questions. ACT science question are helpful as well, as
    the SAT is very similar to the ACT, and LSAT books can also be a source of useful information for data reasoning
    questions. The best overall advice is simply to read. Read widely, and read difficult, challenging articles from
    well-respected sources. You should also familiarize yourself with graphs and data charts, as these will be more
    prevalent on the new test, not only in the math section, but also in the reading sections. </h3>

<h3>We have 6 practices test that may assist you in your journey.</h3>

<h1><strong>Scores</strong></h1>
<h3>The SAT scoring system is simple. Each of the test's two halves are scored out of 800 points, for a total of 1600.
    The optional essay is scored from 2-8, with cross test scores rated from 10-40 and subscores rated from 1-15. </h3>
<h3>You earn points for correct answers and there is no advantage to leaving questions blank, as there was in previous
    years. There is no penalty for wrong answers, so it is to your advantage to answer every question, even if you are
    guessing. Raw test scores are converted into an overall scaled score using a sliding chart method that accounts for
    variations on different tests and test dates. This scoring method is designed so that there is no advantage to
    taking a particular test, or taking a test on a particular day. </h3>

<h3>Scores are available a few weeks after the test date. They are relayed by a paper report, by phone, or online.
    Students who want to double-check their answers after receiving their scores have access to College Board's
    <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/scores/verifying-scores">Score Verification</a> services.</h3>
